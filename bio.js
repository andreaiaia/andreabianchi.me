            <p>I always liked coding and photography, and I graduated in 2019 in Communication Science at the Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna.</p>
            <p>I decided to proceed and get a new degree in Computer Science - for which I am currently studying - and in the meantime I got a job at a law firm in Matera; <em>my current task</em> here is to take care of social account and make a website of my employer.</p>

            <p>I absolutely love putting my party in awful situations in <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em>, reading and binge-watching my favourite TV shows.</p>
            <p>I always loved <em>Photography</em> and <em>Coding</em>. Now I study CS science at the University of Bologna and I create websites in my free time. Oh, almost forgot, <em>I shoot on film!</em> (apparently I am legally obliged to say it, it's part of some kind of film shooters code).</p>
            <p>Anyway the slider says this is the funny bio, so here is a <em>joke</em>:</p>
            <p>A doctor, an architect and a programmer talk about their professions. "Mine is the oldest", says the doctor, "as everybody knows God created Eve from the rib of Adam, and that's definitely a medical operation". "Right", says the architect, "but in fact architecture is even older - it's definitely an architectural project to create the world from chaos". At this point the programmer kicks back in the chair and gives friends a mysterious look. "Who do you think <em>created the chaos?</em>".</p>
