            <p>I prefered to proceed and get a new degree in Computer Science - for which I am currently studying - and in the meanwhile I got a job at a law firm in Matera; <em>my current task</em> here is to take care of the social account and make a website of my employer.</p>

            <p>A doctor, an architect and a programmer talk about their professions. "Mine is the oldest", says the doctor, "as everybody knows God created Eve from the rib of Adam, and that's definitely a medical operation". "Right", says the architect, "but in fact architect is even older - it's definitely an architectural project to create the world from chaos". At this point the programmer kicks back in the chair and gives friends a mysterious look. "Who, do you think, <em>created the chaos?</em>".</p>
