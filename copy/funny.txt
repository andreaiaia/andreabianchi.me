I'm a 24 years old man from Italy, Europe!

I absolutely love putting my party in awful situations in Dungeons & Dragons, I enjoy reading and binge-watching my favourite TV shows.

I always loved Photography and Coding. Now I study CS science at the University of Bologna and I create websites in my free time. Oh, almost forgot, I shoot film! (apparently I am legally obliged to say it, it's part of some kind of film shooters code).

Anyway the slider says this is the funny bio, so here is a joke:

A doctor, an architect and a programmer talk about their professions. "Mine is the oldest", says the doctor, "as everybody knows God created Eve from the rib of Adam, and that's definitely a medical operation". "Right", says the architect, "but in fact architect is even older - it's definitely an architectural project to create the world from chaos". At this point the programmer kicks back in the chair and gives friends a mysterious look. "Who, do you think, created the chaos?".
