I am a 24 years old developer from Italy.

I am proficient with HTML, CSS, JS and I know how to use softwares like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, VS Code, Various Linux distros, Git and Github and, for all my notes and docs, I use Notion.

I always liked coding and photography and I graduated in 2019 in Communication Science at the Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna.

I prefered to proceed and get a new degree in Computer Science - for which I am currently studying - and in the meanwhile I got a job at a law firm in Matera; my current task here is to take care of the social account and make a website of my employer.
