Hi, I'm a 24 year old CS student and web developer from Italy, Europe!
I graduated in 2019 in Communication Science at the Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna. Instead of continue with a master's degree (I didn't like the ones available) I choose to take a new degree in Computer Science, for which I currently am studying.

In the meanwhile I learned HTML, CSS and JS and I create websites, like this one! I love photography and I'm good with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.

I take my privacy very seriously and I like to help others protect their as well, that's why I started my own podcast privacy-focused: INSERT_NAME_HERE.
