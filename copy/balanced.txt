<p>Hi, I'm a 24 year old CS student and web developer from <em>Italy</em>, Europe! ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º </p>
            <p>I graduated in 2019 in Communication Science at the Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna. </p>
            <p>Instead of continuing with a master's degree (I didn't like the ones available) I chose to take a <em>new degree</em> in Computer Science, for which I am currently studying.</p>
            <p>In the meanwhile I learned <em>HTML, CSS and JS</em> and I create websites, like this one! I love photography and I have expertise with Adobe <em>Photoshop</em> and <em>Lightroom</em>.</p>
